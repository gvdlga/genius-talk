# Security and Performance

*   **Security:**
    *   All endpoints are protected via token authentication provided by the BetterAuth framework, ensuring secure access control for both users and agents.
    *   **BetterAuth Security Features:**
        *   **Token Management:** BetterAuth handles the secure generation, validation, and expiration of authentication tokens (e.g., JWTs, API tokens).
        *   **Secure Credential Storage:** It manages user credentials securely, typically using hashing and salting techniques.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Built-in rate limiting helps protect against brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attempts.
        *   **Input Validation:** BetterAuth performs validation on authentication-related inputs, reducing the risk of injection attacks.
        *   **Session Management:** Secure session management ensures that user sessions are properly created, maintained, and invalidated.
        *   **Extensibility for Advanced Security:** Supports plugins for features like Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and multi-tenancy, enhancing overall security posture.
    *   Input validation is enforced with `zod`.
    *   Secrets are managed via environment variables.
    *   A strict Content Security Policy (CSP) is used on the frontend.
*   **Performance:**
    *   **Frontend:** Aims for <250KB initial bundle size, leveraging Next.js features like code splitting and SSR.
    *   **Backend:** Aims for <200ms average API response time, using database indexing and Redis caching.
