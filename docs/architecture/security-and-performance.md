# Security and Performance

*   **Security:**
    *   All endpoints are protected via token authentication.
    *   Input validation is enforced with `zod`.
    *   Secrets are managed via environment variables.
    *   A strict Content Security Policy (CSP) is used on the frontend.
*   **Performance:**
    *   **Frontend:** Aims for <250KB initial bundle size, leveraging Next.js features like code splitting and SSR.
    *   **Backend:** Aims for <200ms average API response time, using database indexing and Redis caching.
