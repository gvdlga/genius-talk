- **Total Ideas Generated:** 17
- **Key Themes Identified:** Core Chat Experience, Advanced Collaboration, Governance & Traceability, System Architecture & Scalability

## Technique: Mind Mapping

### Central Topic: Genius-Talk: Human-AI Coworking

#### Main Branch: Chat functionality

- **Sub-branch: Message Types**
    - Instructions
    - Questions
    - General Information
- **Sub-branch: Request Status Updates**
    - Acknowledgment of receipt (e.g., "Working on it...")
    - Visual indicators (e.g., spinner, progress bar)
    - Notifications on completion

#### Main Branch: Traceability & Monitoring

- **Sub-branch: Audit Trail**
    - Sender (human or agent)
    - Request details
    - Responder(s) (human or agent)
    - Response details
    - Timestamps for all events
- **Sub-branch: Real-time Dashboard**
    - Key metrics (e.g., open requests, average response time)
    - Live feed of conversations
- **Sub-branch: Searchable Conversation History**
    - Full-text search of all messages
    - Filtering by sender, receiver, date, etc.
    - View full conversation context for any search result

#### Main Branch: Collaborative Response

- **Sub-branch: Handling Conflicting Responses**
    - **Conflict Resolution Mechanisms**
        - Dedicated Conflict Resolver (human or agent) to review and decide.
    - **Trustability Index**
        - Weight responses based on a trust score.
        - Factors: Human vs. Agent, Seniority/Expertise Level, Historical Accuracy.
        - Example: Senior human > Junior human, Specialist Agent > Generalist Agent.
        - **Dynamic Score Maintenance**
            - Score adjusts automatically based on performance.
            - Requires a mechanism for rating response quality.
            - **Response Rating Authority (Context-Dependent)**:
                - The original requester (primary rater).
                - Any user viewing the conversation (secondary/social validation).
                - Designated QA reviewers/managers (authoritative rating).
                - **Flag for Review Mechanism**: Allows a user to escalate a response for authoritative review if they feel unqualified to judge.
                - *Note: The system must be flexible, as the requester may not always be the best judge.*

#### Main Branch: Communication Channels

- **Sub-branch: Channel Types**
    - **Public Channels**: Open for anyone in the organization to join.
    - **Private/Authorized Channels**: Access restricted to specific users or groups by invitation or permission.
    - *Note: The specific channel structure should be configurable by the organization.*

- **Sub-branch: Interaction Models**
    - **Directed Communication**: Messages sent to a specific user/agent require a response.
    - **Proactive Agent Assistance**: Agents passively monitor channels and can choose to contribute if a request matches their skills, even if not directly addressed.
        - *Design Principle: Decoupling of Requester from Provider. The system should be flexible enough to add/remove agents without the requester's knowledge, improving scalability and response quality.*
