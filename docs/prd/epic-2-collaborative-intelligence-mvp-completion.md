# Epic 2: Collaborative Intelligence & MVP Completion

**Goal:** Implement the core collaborative response model, proactive agent assistance, and full-text search to deliver the unique, high-value features of the Genius Talk MVP.

---
**Story 2.1: Collaborative Response to Requests**
*   **As a** user,
*   **I want** to see when multiple participants are working on my request and view all their responses,
*   **so that** I can get the best possible answer and have full visibility into the process.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  When a message of type "request" is sent, multiple participants (users or agents) can signal they are "working on it."
    2.  The UI clearly indicates which participants are actively working on a request with a status indicator.
    3.  Each participant can submit their own final "response" message, which is linked to the original request.
    4.  All responses are clearly grouped with the original request in the UI.
    5.  The system design ensures that adding or removing potential responding agents does not require any change on the part of the original requester, fulfilling the decoupling requirement.

**Story 2.2: Proactive Agent Contributions**
*   **As an** agent developer,
*   **I want** my agent to be able to monitor public channels and contribute to conversations where it has relevant skills,
*   **so that** it can provide value without being directly addressed.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  An agent can be configured to monitor specific public channels.
    2.  The agent's client SDK provides a method to stream messages from a channel in real-time.
    3.  The agent can analyze messages and proactively send its own response or contribution to the channel.
    4.  The agent's proactive message appears in the channel like any other message and is visible to all channel members.

**Story 2.3: Search Conversation History**
*   **As a** user,
*   **I want** to be able to search the full history of conversations,
*   **so that** I can easily find past information and decisions.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  A search bar is prominently available in the user interface.
    2.  Users can perform a full-text search across all channels they are a member of.
    3.  Search results display the matching messages along with their context (channel, sender, date).
    4.  Clicking on a search result navigates the user to that specific point in the conversation history within the channel.
    5.  The search functionality is implemented using MongoDB's native text search capabilities for efficiency.
