## Background Context
Genius Talk is a message-based communication platform designed for seamless collaboration between humans and AI agents. It addresses the complexity of building and scaling multi-agent systems, which are often rigid and single-purpose. By providing a flexible and auditable communication backbone, Genius Talk enables organizations to incrementally adopt AI, freeing up human talent for more strategic work. The long-term vision is for Genius Talk to become the central nervous system for the modern enterprise, coordinating all work performed by both humans and AI.
