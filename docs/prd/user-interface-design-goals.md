# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The user experience should be clean, intuitive, and developer-centric. It should feel like a professional tool, prioritizing clarity and efficiency over flashy design. The interface should make it easy to monitor conversations, manage agents, and quickly understand the status of any request.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
*   **Asynchronous Collaboration:** The UI must excel at displaying multiple, simultaneous responses to a single request without creating confusion.
*   **Real-time Updates:** The interface should feel alive, with status changes, new messages, and agent activities updating in real-time without requiring a page refresh.
*   **Drill-Down for Detail:** Users should be able to see a high-level overview and then easily click to drill down into the full context of any conversation, including all messages, participants, and timestamps.

## Core Screens and Views
*   **Dashboard:** A central hub showing key metrics and a real-time feed of all conversations.
*   **Channel View:** The main view for interacting with conversations within a specific channel.
*   **Request Detail View:** A focused view showing a single request and all its associated responses and status updates.
*   **Agent Management:** A screen for administrators to add, remove, and configure AI agents.
*   **User Management:** A screen for administrators to manage users and their permissions.

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
The application will adhere to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA to ensure it is usable by people with a wide range of disabilities.

## Branding
The branding will be professional and minimalist, with a focus on clarity and readability. The color palette will be simple, using a modern, tech-oriented aesthetic.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
The primary platform is a responsive web application that works seamlessly on modern desktop browsers.
