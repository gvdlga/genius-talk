# Story 1.1: Project Foundation & Integration

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a new Next.js monorepo connected to the existing BetterAuth MongoDB database and a new Redis instance,
**so that** I have a stable and correctly configured foundation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The project is set up as a monorepo containing a Next.js application.
2. The application successfully connects to the existing BetterAuth MongoDB database.
3. The application successfully connects to a Redis instance.
4. A basic CI/CD pipeline is established.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1 (AC: 1): Set up the monorepo structure using npm workspaces. [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Create the `apps/web` directory for the Next.js application.
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Create the `packages/shared` and `packages/config` directories.
- [x] Task 3 (AC: 2): Create a new Next.js application in `apps/web`.
- [x] Task 4 (AC: 3): Configure the Next.js application to connect to the BetterAuth MongoDB database. [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md, architecture/database-schema.md]
  - [x] Subtask 4.1: Add MongoDB connection details to `.env.local`.
  - [x] Subtask 4.2: Create a Mongoose connection utility.
- [x] Task 5 (AC: 4): Configure the Next.js application to connect to Redis. [Source: architecture/components.md]
  - [x] Subtask 5.1: Add Redis connection details to `.env.local`.
  - [x] Subtask 5.2: Create a Redis client utility.
- [x] Task 6 (AC: 5): Create a basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
  - [x] Subtask 6.1: Create a GitHub Actions workflow file that runs on push to the main branch.
  - [x] Subtask 6.2: The workflow should install dependencies, build the Next.js application, and run tests.

### Technical Constraints
- **Monorepo:** The project must be a monorepo managed with npm workspaces.
- **Next.js:** The web application must be built with Next.js.
- **MongoDB:** The database is MongoDB, and Mongoose should be used for object modeling.
- **Redis:** Redis is used for caching and real-time messaging.

### Testing
- **Unit Tests:** Jest and React Testing Library for frontend components.
- **API Tests:** Jest and Supertest for API routes.
- **E2E Tests:** Playwright for end-to-end testing.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-08

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The initial implementation was a good starting point, but lacked some robustness and best practices. The refactoring has improved the code quality by adding better error handling, type safety, and performance optimizations.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `apps/web/src/lib/dbConnect.ts`
  - **Change**: Added more robust error handling and logging to the Mongoose connection utility. Added typing for the global cache.
  - **Why**: To make the database connection more resilient and easier to debug.
  - **How**: By adding a `.catch` block to the promise and typing the `cached` object.

- **File**: `apps/web/src/lib/redisClient.ts`
  - **Change**: Refactored the Redis client utility to be a singleton.
  - **Why**: To avoid creating multiple Redis clients, which can lead to performance issues.
  - **How**: By creating the client only if it doesn't exist and reusing the existing client.

- **File**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  - **Change**: Added caching for npm dependencies to the CI workflow.
  - **Why**: To speed up the CI pipeline.
  - **How**: By using the `cache` option in the `setup-node` action.
